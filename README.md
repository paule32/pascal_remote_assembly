# pascal_remote_assembly
Transforms pascal code to asmjit remote assembly code. Then the code will be prepare to compile with nasm. And the result is a test.asm, and test.o file.
The source code is based on msys2 MingW64 GNU C/C++

I used Bison, and Flex - which are called yacc, and flex, too, to create the Pascal-Parser.
